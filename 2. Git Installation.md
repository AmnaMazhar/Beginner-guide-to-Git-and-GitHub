1. **Git Bash**
   
    Git Bash is CLI (Command Line Interface).

2. **Git GUI**

    Git GUI is, as the name suggests, Graphical User Interface.

Note: This is the example of Windows 10. For MAC or Linux, options would be different but you should be easily able to find them out with little research.
