# How to Create a Folder in GitHub Repository

You cannot create an empty folder and then add files to that folder, but rather creation of a folder must happen together with adding of at least a single file. 
This is because git doesn't track empty folders.

## Creating a Folder in GitHub Repository

Here is the step by step guide on how to create a folder in GitHub Repository:

 1. Open **Repository** in which you want to create a folder and click on **Add file** then click on **Create new file**.

 2. Write **folder name** with **slash(/)**.
 
   !["folder-name"](./images/folder_name.png)
 
  After **slash(/)**, you will see a folder name.
